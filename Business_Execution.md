# FOCO: Business Execution Report

## Methodology so far
<!-- How have we run our business so far?  -->

We set up team roles based on individual strengths in order to create a suitable prototype for our users quickly. We have 5 members, who all have distinct roles: CEO, CFO, CMO, Developer Lead and Product Manager. When selecting our roles, because all of us have previously worked in a coursework group, we could easily identify each member’s core strengths and knew how the dynamic between us would be, as well as how to boost team morale efficiently.

We used an Agile methodology to execute the initial plans of our business. We chose this methodology because it is a collaborative framework that has worked well for us when we last worked together and suits with the dynamics of our team as well as the need to design a prototype and create an app to market for this assignment. Additionally, Agile is flexible and adaptible. This is beneficial especially, if at any stage of executing our business, its current direction is not working, which can happen often in a product’s initial stages because user needs and market conditions can change rapidly, especially if a product has novelty elements, which our app does. Furthermore, because Agile is faster to implement than other methodologies, it would therefore allow us to gain feedback and start monetising earlier, especially as we are releasing an early version of our app.

However, despite the strengths of the Agile framework for executing our business in its initial stages, there are also drawbacks to using this methodology, especially if we want to use the framework beyond the initial stages of developing FOCO. One of the main challenges is that the Agile Framework can cause us to lack planning in the long-term as the methodology focuses on short sprints and could lead to a lack of big-picture thinking, which is needed in entrepreneurship. This could lead to our team developing a product that does not have a coherent overall strategy. In order to mitigate this, we arranged weekly meetings to discuss individual progress and to evaluate whether our progress aligns well with FOCO’s strategic direction. A challenge that we also addressed is customer confusion that can arise, especially when demonstrating our app to early users because Agile methodologies have frequent updates and features can easily change, which can lead to confusion. To mitigate this challenge, we initially advertised our app to students within our department for early feedback before we started marketing to students in other departments at our university because computer science students are familiar with the Agile methodology and user testing and could give us more insightful feedback that could help us identify weaknesses in our product that may cause user confusion. Looking towards the future, an issue that can arise is scaling because Agile is a suitable methodology for small teams but, if we gain additional members as our business develops, we may need to consider methodologies such as SCRUM or Waterfall in order to deal with more members and new team dynamics. 

To initialise our business plan, we implemented a working prototype in Figma and designed a website for advertising our app. We also worked on marketing our app towards students at our university by creating posters and flyers to hand out to students around campus to gain early customers. We initially started with students studying computer science because computer science students are very familiar with user testing and could provide us some additional insight compared to students unfamiliarised usability tests work. Furthermore, as computer science students, we believed that, we would have a common ground to talk about, especially with third or fourth-year students as they may also be enrolled in the Entrepreneurship module.

## Plan Progression
<!-- How far we have gotten with the business plan?  -->

Clearly, since first laying out our production timeline, we have made good progress towards setting up a sustainable and thriving business framework, already tackling a number of goals laid out in the Priority Roadmap Section (3.1). However, since then, we have also come across new information/insights. A good business plan is a dynamic one, hence we would like to point out some of the most notable changes we are making to proposed product and business strategy.


### Issue 1 - 2.6.2 Primary Challenges and Risks

#### Blocking Apps Successfully
<!-- How do we ensure that the MVP can actually block other apps? -->

In our planning phase, we correctly identified the ability (or lack thereof) of our app successfully blocking/restricting other apps as the greatest "existential threat" to our product. Whilst it is clear that others have successfully implemented such features, we were unsure how difficult this would be and so we immediately turned our attention to prototyping and verifying this for ourselves after the planning phase concluded. From this initial prototyping phase, we have confirmed that it is quite difficult to restrict other apps in this way. As a result, we have focussed our attention on researching, particularly in the Flutter documentation as well as similar projects and threads related to app restriction.

#### Going Cross-Platform
<!-- How do we ensure functionality across all OSs? -->

Following on from this, we have identified a number of potential methods and are in the process of testing each one. However, these methods are now raising a second potential risk to the business plan as several of them are OS specific, and so using them would mean narrowing our target audience quite significantly. We believe this to be a pertinent issue as a lack of cross-compatibility would substantially limit our potential revenue and are considering different ways of circumventing this issue (mainly, whether we keep researching for an all-encompassing solution for each OS, or implementing specific solutions for each one).


### Issue 2 - 2.7 Assumptions and Risk Assessment

On a related topic, we will be adding the issue of cross-compatibility to our official risk assessment based on the reasoning specified above.


### Issue 3 - 2.2 Use Cases and Storyboarding

#### Setting permissions
<!-- How will the system interact with app permission settings? -->

While we have several potential methods with different approaches, one area in which they all share from is their use of permissions. From the beginning, it was obvious to us that the app would require the user to allow FOCO with some form of permissions, however it seems that we overlooked this when writing out our business plan. Hence, we will add this part of the user experience to our storyboards. Furthermore, we have begun noting down (from our prototyping) what specific permissions may be required.


#### Blocking method
<!-- How will the blocking method be manifested to the user? -->

Additionally, we also decided to rethink how the blocking/restriction would actually be manifested to the user. While superficial, we did not properly consider what the block would look like, whether simply creating a notification or fully displaying a window to the user. Such gaps in design are to be expected as each of us has our own ideas and we all implicity have a collective idea, yet we failed to properly transfer this to our design. We are continuing to mull over the best way to present this to the user (since this is the primary barrier, we believe that implementing this well or poorly will impact how effectively FOCO assists the user psychologically in conquering their bad screen habits). As part of this, we are revisiting our market research and rigorously documenting the methods used by our competitors, weighting up their pros and cons, and we will soon use this to inform the development of our initial product.



## Raising capital
<!-- How have we raised money to support the business in the initial phase?  -->

At this time we already have approached various friends and family for investment. This investment will be used to fund the initial marketing budget in order to start building a brand. We have had so signs of interesting with from a investors. This initial investment will go towards the marketing of our product specifically on TikTok (as this is, by definition, is our target audience). The target for this  initial capital raise is £3000 as TikTok estimates to convert to 50,000 clicks, which will establish our presence and allow our product to start spreading by word of mouth. This would also allow us to recoup our initial investment if only 6% of those who clicked purchased only one month of premium.

List of prospective investors

| Investor  | Investment | Equity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Charlotte Morris | £1000 | 6.7% |
| TJ Rawlinson | £500  | 3.3% |
| Dhru’s Mum | £500  | 3.3% |
| Sammy | £150 | 1% |
| Total | £2150 | 14.3% |

This investment however is all contingent on the completion of a working v1.0 of our app being published to the google play store. In order to get to this point the team has/is planning to cover the upfront costs as they are relatively small and as such are able to be payed out of pocket by the team, these include:

- £7.50 - **Domain Acquisition:** We secured https://focodigital.co.uk as our digital headquarters, prioritizing this investment to establish a professional online presence from day one. We researched our options for purchasing this domain, and found that Cloudflare was the easiest option, as it worked well as a hosting provider, and was a reputable source for domain purchasing.
- £25.00 - **Google Play:** Initially, we decided to launch on Google play instead of the App Store. This is because we have completed our initial development on Flutter Studio, which emulates an Android phone, and additionally the pricing model is much cheaper to get started, taking a 15% cut instead of Apple’s 30% cut.
- £50 - **Company House Registration (Planned):** We intend to register *The Focus Corporation* as a limited company with Companies House in the near future. This will formalize our operations, providing legal protection to our investors. Setting up as a limited company also opens the door to more professional opportunities, such as business banking and grant applications, while securing our brand name officially.
