## 1. Overview of FOCO
FOCO is a productivity app that implements a coin-based system to minimise screen time on reductive apps. FOCO works by giving users a specific amount of coins, which the user can then spend based on the apps they are using. At the start of the week, the user must configure the settings for the apps on their device. They can either set a negative number of coins, which is used for reductive apps, or a positive number for productive apps. The number of coins they set for an app would be the rate at which they gain or lose coins, whilst interacting with that app for a specific amount of time. If the user runs out of coins, all reductive apps would be blocked on their device and the only way the user would be able to access these apps would be to spend time interacting with productive apps.

<!-- TOC --><a name="11-customer"></a>
### 1.1 Our Customer
FOCO is aimed at people wanting to improve their wellbeing or productivity. Despite our app being able to target a lot of demographics due to screen time dependency being a widespread issue [[1]](#ref-1), FOCO’s main audience is students and working professionals as these audiences most likely need to focus on projects at school or work and would need to reduce their screen time on reductive apps in order to focus more on tasks that could benefit their education or professional lifestyle. We also chose students and working professionals as our main audience because our team have had personal experiences with having screen-time-related issues, which has given us motivation to create this app. As a result of our app being focused on increasing productivity, our marketing strategy also involves getting sponsorships or promotions from apps or content creators that focus on education, wellbeing or productivity.

<!-- TOC --><a name="12-customer-needs"></a>
### 1.2 Customer Needs
Customers seeking a screen time manager app are primarily motivated by a desire to regain control over their digital habits. Many users struggle with excessive time spent on unproductive apps like social media, mobile games, or content streaming platforms, often at the expense of their mental health, productivity, or personal goals. These users are looking for a tool that goes beyond passive tracking and actively supports behavior change. They want an intuitive, engaging system that helps them not only become aware of their screen time patterns but also provides clear, motivating incentives to reduce usage on apps they deem unproductive.

<!-- TOC --><a name="13-value-proposition"></a>
### 1.3 Value Proposition
Our product is a coin-based screen time management app designed with an emphasis on flexibility while still promoting lasting changes in behavior. During the initial setup, users assign a value—or "cost"—to each app they use. This cost can be positive, negative, or neutral, depending on whether they view the app as productive, unproductive, or somewhere in between.

Each day, users are given a set screen time budget in the form of coins. As they use their devices, time spent on apps will either spend, earn, or have no effect on their daily coin balance, based on the values they’ve set. This system gives users the freedom to make intentional choices about how they spend their time, offering day-to-day flexibility while still encouraging mindful use.

By turning screen time management into a budgeting game, our app helps users become more aware of their habits and empowers them to take control—without rigid restrictions. The goal is to make reducing unproductive screen time both achievable and motivating, while still leaving room for balance and enjoyment.

<!-- TOC --><a name="15-selling-proposition"></a>
### 1.5 Unique Selling Proposition
Our product’s primary value proposition lies in its substantially lower cost, enabled by a zero operating cost model that leverages users’ existing storage infrastructure. In contrast, market alternatives such as Opal — our leading competitor — charge $19.99 per month or $99.99 annually, with similar pricing models seen across the industry, due to the additional server costs of these companies and significant markup. This pricing disparity presents a significant market opportunity for a low-cost, user-friendly app blocking solution.

Moreover, our integrated coin system offers a distinctive advantage by introducing a gamified experience that encourages users to reduce screen time in an engaging and effective way.

## 2. Methodology
<!-- How have we run our business so far?  -->

<!-- TOC --><a name="21-team-roles"></a>
### 2.1. Team Roles
We set up team roles based on individual strengths in order to create a suitable prototype for our users quickly. We have 5 members, who all have distinct roles: CEO, CFO, CMO, Developer Lead and Product Manager. When selecting our roles, because all of us have previously worked in a coursework group, we could easily identify each member’s core strengths and knew how the dynamic between us would be, as well as how to boost team morale efficiently. It should be noted that the current stage of the company that all team members share responsibility, and as the company matures the roles may change as they become more strictly defined.

| Name             | Role     | Reasons Why They are Suitable for the Role  |         
| ---------------- |------------------| ------------------------------------------- |
| Tom Pecher       | CEO              | Has prior experience as a team leader in university projects |
| Marilyn D'Costa  | CFO              | Specialises in data science and business strategy in her computer science degree |
| Dhru Randeria    | CMO              | Has prior work experience as a social media ambassador for the University of Bath |
| George Rawlinson | Developer Lead   | Has a high level of technical proficiency and previous work experience as a professional software developer |
| Ptolemy Morris   | Product Manager  | Has previous stakeholder engagement experience |


<!-- TOC --><a name="22-agile"></a>
### 2.2. Agile Framework
We used an Agile methodology to execute the initial plans of our business. We chose this methodology because it is a collaborative framework that has worked well for us when we last worked together and suits with the dynamics of our team as well as the need to design a prototype and create an app to market for this assignment. Additionally, Agile is flexible and adaptible. This is beneficial especially, if at any stage of executing our business, its current direction is not working, which can happen often in a product’s initial stages because user needs and market conditions can change rapidly, especially if a product has novelty elements, which our app does. Furthermore, because Agile is faster to implement than other methodologies, it would therefore allow us to gain feedback and start monetising earlier, especially as we are releasing an early version of our app.

However, despite the strengths of the Agile framework for executing our business in its initial stages, there are also drawbacks to using this methodology, especially if we want to use the framework beyond the initial stages of developing FOCO. One of the main challenges is that the Agile Framework can cause us to lack planning in the long-term as the methodology focuses on short sprints and could lead to a lack of big-picture thinking, which is needed in entrepreneurship. This could lead to our team developing a product that does not have a coherent overall strategy. In order to mitigate this, we arranged weekly meetings to discuss individual progress and to evaluate whether our progress aligns well with FOCO’s strategic direction. A challenge that we also addressed is customer confusion that can arise, especially when demonstrating our app to early users because Agile methodologies have frequent updates and features can easily change, which can lead to confusion. To mitigate this challenge, we initially advertised our app to students within our department for early feedback before we started marketing to students in other departments at our university because computer science students are familiar with the Agile methodology and user testing and could give us more insightful feedback that could help us identify weaknesses in our product that may cause user confusion. Looking towards the future, an issue that can arise is scaling because Agile is a suitable methodology for small teams but, if we gain additional members as our business develops, we may need to consider methodologies such as SCRUM or Waterfall in order to deal with more members and new team dynamics. 

<!-- TOC --><a name="23-meeting-bp"></a>
### 2.3. Meeting Our Current Business Plan
To initialise our business plan, we implemented a working prototype in Figma (see Appendix [0](#appendix-0)) and designed a website for advertising our app. We also worked on marketing our app towards students at our university by creating posters and flyers to hand out to students around campus to gain early customers. We initially started with students studying computer science because computer science students are very familiar with user testing and could provide us some additional insight compared to students unfamiliarised usability tests work. Furthermore, as computer science students, we believed that, we would have a common ground to talk about, especially with third or fourth-year students as they may also be enrolled in the Entrepreneurship module.

## 3. Completion
<!-- What we have done so far?  -->


<!-- TOC --><a name="31-website"></a>
### 3.1. Website 
In today's digital-first world, our website serves as both our virtual storefront and our most powerful brand ambassador. For FOCO, a platform dedicated to mindful technology use, having a thoughtful online presence isn't just practical - it's essential to our mission and growth strategy.

#### Our domain: Simple, Professional, Memorable

We carefully selected the domain [https://focodigital.co.uk/](https://focodigital.co.uk/) to embody our core values:

- **Intuitive and memorable**: “FOCO” (Derived from Focus Corporation), our business name, is short and distinctive, and instantly conveys our purpose.
- **Professional and approachable**: The name signals credibility while remaining friendly and accessible.
- **Available across platforms: This consistency helps users find us easily through search, social media, or word of mouth.**

#### User - Centric Design Philosophy

Every element of our website has been thoughtfully crafted with our users needs at the forefront:

- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clean menu structure allowing visitors to find information with minimal clicks
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across all devices, with adaptive scaling to fit the user’s device
- **Fast Loading times: Respecting our visitors’ time and attention - practicing what we preach about digital efficiency.**

#### Content that Converts

Our website content strikes a careful balance between informing the user and inspiring action:

- **Clear Value Proposition**: Immediately communicating how FOCO solves the universal problem of digital distraction
- **Evidence-Based Approach**: Incorporating research on digital wellness to build credibility
- **Authentic Testimonials**: Real user stories highlighting tangible benefits like improved productivity, better sleep, and increased mindfulness
- **Compelling Calls-to-Action**: Strategically placed prompts encouraging visitors to download or learn more


<!-- TOC --><a name="32-linkedin"></a>
### 3.2. LinkedIn
Establishing a professional LinkedIn presence for FOCO was identified as a crucial early step in executing our business plan and transitioning from concept to active market engagement. We created a dedicated company page, meticulously populating it with key details including our mission, value proposition, relevant industry tags, and location, ensuring a comprehensive and professional representation of the brand. Initial content posts, such as the introduction to FOCO and its focus on digital wellbeing, were published to begin building awareness and driving engagement towards our primary platform. This online hub serves as a vital tool for implementing our initial marketing strategy, particularly for identifying and initiating contact with potential university and workplace partners as outlined in our plan, and for establishing credibility with prospective users and investors.

Demonstrating entrepreneurial resourcefulness and a commitment to maximizing impact within budget constraints, the team acquired a LinkedIn account for £5 from a connection. Crucially, this account retained its unused Premium free trial—a necessary maneuver as our marketing lead had already exhausted their personal trial eligibility. This creative solution allowed us to access Premium features immediately, circumventing the significant standard monthly subscription cost. The initiative was undertaken specifically to accelerate our outreach efforts and gain a competitive edge. Premium features unlock enhanced visibility for our content and enable direct InMail messaging to key stakeholders, such as experienced app developers, potential mentors, or partnership managers within target organizations. This capability is invaluable for bypassing gatekeepers, capturing the attention of influential individuals, and initiating meaningful conversations that might otherwise be difficult to secure. Furthermore, access to more detailed analytics via Premium will allow us to track engagement, understand our audience better, and refine our communication strategy, ultimately supporting our goal of building momentum and validating FOCO's market potential.


<!-- TOC --><a name="33-prototypes"></a>
### 3.3. Prototypes

#### Functionality Prototype
Based on our risk assessment from our business plan, it was clear to us that successfully and safely overriding other applications would likely be challenging. For this reason, we choose to attack this problem early on by immediately beginning the prototyping process. Our final goal for an MVP is to create a Flutter-based system whose only functionality is to block access to a specified app (the rest of the functionality is superficial and can easily be added afterwards). We chose Flutter as our desired framework due to its cross-platform compatibility, which we believe to be vital to the business model. However, as we anticipated, this functionality is much harder to implement than we had initially thought and we have currently been unsuccessful in implementing this feature in Flutter. This led us back to reassessing our risk assessment to figure out how to deal with this issue (see 4.1). Fortunately, many have had similar issues online and after conducting research on similar systems, we have found several similar systems which we are actively testing to find a solution to our problem. Our Flutter prototype can be found at: [https://github.com/TheGogy/foco](#https://github.com/TheGogy/foco). Whilst developing our Flutter solution, we also began to research and lay out the foundations for uploading our system to the Google Play Store once we are ready to deploy. As such, we created a Google developer account which is now verified and ready:

Since progress with Flutter was very slow, we decided to split our development team, half of which worked on the Flutter system and the other half going back to basics, specifically into making a Python script for Linux only. We did this with the idea that by solving this problem, we could then build upon it until we have a working product that works on all operating systems. This proved to be very successful and we were quickly able to make an implementation that can block access any application. Whilst working as intended, this script is still far too primitive and unsafe to ever be considered an adequate product as its manipulation of system processes has not yet been fully tested and safeguarded against potentially dangerous bugs. Nevertheless, we are very close to having a working system, despite being confined to Linux for the time being. We hope that very soon, we will be able to complete the rest of the functionality (the credit system and customisation) and soon be able to expand to other operating systems. This prototype can be found here: [https://github.com/Tom-Pecher/AppSlayer](#https://github.com/Tom-Pecher/AppSlayer).

### 3.4. Pipeline Manager App

We created a custom-built Partnership Pipeline Manager app (See appendix [1](#appendix-1) using Microsoft Power Apps to streamline and professionalise FOCO’s outreach process. The development journey included both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototype (See appendix [0](#appendix-0)), which helped shape the final product through feedback and iteration. The app centralises partnership leads into a single visual pipeline, replacing fragmented tracking across WhatsApp and Discord. It enables us to manage outreach stages, assign ownership, and ensure consistent follow-ups through integrated LinkedIn and email touchpoints. To improve usability, we outsourced a 30-minute session with a UI/UX consultant who provided valuable design advice that directly informed the app’s look and feel.


To support and amplify our outreach strategy, we also utilised a free trial of LinkedIn Premium. This allowed us to directly message decision-makers, significantly increasing engagement and making the most of the new pipeline manager. The app and LinkedIn Premium were used in tandem — the app tracked the progress of each lead, while LinkedIn enabled direct, targeted messaging. Additionally, we designed and purchased printed posters to advertise FOCO at events and within university spaces. These posters (See appendix [3](#appendix-3) and [2](#appendix-2)) helped spark conversations and raise awareness, building momentum for partnership opportunities. Together, these tools have brought clarity, structure, and increased visibility to FOCO’s outreach efforts.


#### Design Prototype
When thinking about the design of our app and how the user would navigate through the app, we created a low-fidelity prototype using Figma that differentiated itself from the other prototype that focuses on functionality. When designing the low-fidelity prototype, we considered how whether the user would be able to easily navigate through the app and made sure that the font size, buttons and text boxes were designed so that the user can easily navigate through the app without making too many mistakes. We also considered how to make the the text easily readable to the user and made sure that the backgrounds had a high level of contrast from the text and button colours of our app. 

For our Figma Prototype, we have designed the free model for now and have the following pages:

- Login and Sign Up: allows the user to create an account and to keep their screen-time data private
- Main Menu: allows the user to see whether they can configure their setting yet based on whether they are locked or unlocked. From this page, the user can be directed to a Configure Settings or User Insights page
- Configure Settings: allows the user to adjust the coins that an app can gain or lose at a given rate
- User Insights: allows the user to see how many hours they have spent on an app per day, month and year

Once a user has logged in or signed up, they can sign out by clicking the user icon.

## 4. Business Plan Progression
<!-- How far we have gotten with the business plan?  -->

Clearly, since first laying out our production timeline, we have made good progress towards setting up a sustainable and thriving business framework, already tackling a number of goals laid out in the Priority Roadmap Section (3.1). However, since then, we have also come across new information/insights. A good business plan is a dynamic one, hence we would like to point out some of the most notable changes we are making to proposed product and business strategy.


<!-- TOC --><a name="41-issue1"></a>
### 4.1. Issue 1 - 2.6.2 Primary Challenges and Risks

#### Blocking Apps Successfully
<!-- How do we ensure that the MVP can actually block other apps? -->

In our planning phase, we correctly identified the ability (or lack thereof) of our app successfully blocking/restricting other apps as the greatest "existential threat" to our product. Whilst it is clear that others have successfully implemented such features, we were unsure how difficult this would be and so we immediately turned our attention to prototyping and verifying this for ourselves after the planning phase concluded. From this initial prototyping phase, we have confirmed that it is quite difficult to restrict other apps in this way. As a result, we have focussed our attention on researching, particularly in the Flutter documentation as well as similar projects and threads related to app restriction.

#### Going Cross-Platform
<!-- How do we ensure functionality across all OSs? -->

Following on from this, we have identified a number of potential methods and are in the process of testing each one. However, these methods are now raising a second potential risk to the business plan as several of them are OS specific, and so using them would mean narrowing our target audience quite significantly. We believe this to be a pertinent issue as a lack of cross-compatibility would substantially limit our potential revenue and are considering different ways of circumventing this issue (mainly, whether we keep researching for an all-encompassing solution for each OS, or implementing specific solutions for each one).


<!-- TOC --><a name="42-issue2"></a>
### 4.2. Issue 2 - 2.7 Assumptions and Risk Assessment

On a related topic, we will be adding the issue of cross-compatibility to our official risk assessment based on the reasoning specified above.


<!-- TOC --><a name="43-issue3"></a>
### 4.3. Issue 3 - 2.2 Use Cases and Storyboarding

#### Setting permissions
<!-- How will the system interact with app permission settings? -->

While we have several potential methods with different approaches, one area in which they all share from is their use of permissions. From the beginning, it was obvious to us that the app would require the user to allow FOCO with some form of permissions, however it seems that we overlooked this when writing out our business plan. Hence, we will add this part of the user experience to our storyboards. Furthermore, we have begun noting down (from our prototyping) what specific permissions may be required.


#### Blocking method
<!-- How will the blocking method be manifested to the user? -->

Additionally, we also decided to rethink how the blocking/restriction would actually be manifested to the user. While superficial, we did not properly consider what the block would look like, whether simply creating a notification or fully displaying a window to the user. Such gaps in design are to be expected as each of us has our own ideas and we all implicity have a collective idea, yet we failed to properly transfer this to our design. We are continuing to mull over the best way to present this to the user (since this is the primary barrier, we believe that implementing this well or poorly will impact how effectively FOCO assists the user psychologically in conquering their bad screen habits). As part of this, we are revisiting our market research and rigorously documenting the methods used by our competitors, weighting up their pros and cons, and we will soon use this to inform the development of our initial product.



<!-- TOC --><a name="5-raising-capital"></a>
## 5. Raising Capital 
<!-- How have we raised money to support the business in the initial phase?  -->

At this time we already have approached various friends and family for investment. This investment will be used to fund the initial marketing budget in order to start building a brand. We have had so signs of interesting with from a investors. This initial investment will go towards the marketing of our product specifically on TikTok (as this is, by definition, is our target audience). The target for this  initial capital raise is £3000 as TikTok estimates to convert to 50,000 clicks, which will establish our presence and allow our product to start spreading by word of mouth. This would also allow us to recoup our initial investment if only 6% of those who clicked purchased only one month of premium.

List of prospective investors:

| Investor  | Investment | Equity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Charlotte Morris | £1000 | 6.7% |
| TJ Rawlinson | £500  | 3.3% |
| Jitesh Randeria | £500  | 3.3% |
| Sammy Ndenecho | £150 | 1% |
| Total | £2150 | 14.3% |

This investment however is all contingent on the completion of a working v1.0 of our app being published to the google play store. In order to get to this point the team has/is planning to cover the upfront costs as they are relatively small and as such are able to be payed out of pocket by the team, these include:

- £7.50 - **Domain Acquisition:** We secured https://focodigital.co.uk as our digital headquarters, prioritizing this investment to establish a professional online presence from day one. We researched our options for purchasing this domain, and found that Cloudflare was the easiest option, as it worked well as a hosting provider, and was a reputable source for domain purchasing.
- £25.00 - **Google Play:** Initially, we decided to launch on Google play instead of the App Store. This is because we have completed our initial development on Flutter Studio, which emulates an Android phone, and additionally the pricing model is much cheaper to get started, taking a 15% cut instead of Apple’s 30% cut.
- £50 - **Company House Registration (Planned):** We intend to register *The Focus Corporation* as a limited company with Companies House in the near future. This will formalize our operations, providing legal protection to our investors. Setting up as a limited company also opens the door to more professional opportunities, such as business banking and grant applications, while securing our brand name officially.


<!-- TOC --><a name="6-product-testing"></a>
## 6. Product Testing
<!-- How have we tested the product and what results did we get?  -->

<!-- TOC --><a name="61-user-studies"></a>
### 6.1. User Studies

We got users to provide us feedback for our Figma low-fidelity prototype and our website. We asked users whether it is easy to navigate through the Figma prototype and the website, what they liked about their design and whether they could think of anything that could help in regards to the layout of these interfaces that could benefit users.

Before we conducted a user study with any of our users, we adhered to the University of Bath's Ethics Guidelines and also emailed our tutors to provide them insight into how we will collect data and conduct our user studies. From completing the Ethics Guidelines, we made sure to provide the users a Participant Information Sheet that they could sign to provide consent and we also made sure that they knew that they could withdraw at any time via word-of-mouth and the Participant Information sheet. The users we collected data from are also older than 18 years old and have no impairments and we stored the feedback that they gave us on the University of Bath servers.

<!-- TOC --><a name="62-user-feedback"></a>
### 6.2. User Feedback

From the feedback we have received so far, users have agreed that the website is easy to navigate and the layout of our prototype is easy to understand for users. Notable positive feedback that was mentioned was that there was not massive blocks of text, which made it easy for users to read and understand, and that the pictures in our website did not take over from the content of our website but worked in a way to help users to easily visualise how our app works in order to help out our customers. 

The main criticism we had was that the contrast between the headings of our website and the backgrounds could be more defined because a more defined contrast can help older users or users with visual impairments to view the content of our website easily (see Appendix [4](#appendix-4)). Another criticism we received was that one of our graphs (see Appendix [4](#appendix-4)) could have been explained in a bit more detail as it was confusing to one of our users because it look like the user would spend more time using FOCO, when our graph was supposed to represent the amount of time left in the day from using FOCO in comparison to not using FOCO.

A suggestion that was given for our website was to include video content that can demonstrate how our app works either by an explanation of how the coin system works or a visual demonstration of a user interacting with our app. This is feedback that we will plan to implement once we have a complete version of our app as we want to market our app via social media. We believe that a YouTube channel that has videos to demonstrate our app or working with content creators in a field related to productivity, such as wellbeing or education, to demonstrate and review our app would be useful to market our app, especially because there are many student content creators that promote being productive and offer advice in order to motivate their audience to be productive in order to succeed [[a]](#ref-a).

For our Figma prototype, we did not receive many points of criticism because most users agreed that they liked the contrast between the background colours and the text and methods of user input, which made it easy for users to read and to navigate. However, from looking at our prototype after sending it to users for testing, we noticed that it could be easier for users to understand when they can reconfigure their app settings if some text could display how long the user has until they can reconfigure their settings. Another thing that we have not considered in our low-fidelity prototype is user personalisation, which we could create by creating a Personalisation Settings page that could appear alongside the sign out option when the user icon is pressed. This personalisation page could be used to allow the user to change font size or colour, font type or background colour in order to improve user navigation and readability. This could be especially useful to neurodivergent audiences the neurodiverse find it easier, if there are specific colours [[b]](#ref-b) or fonts [[c]](#ref-c) used.


<!-- TOC --><a name="7-conclusion"></a>
## 7. Conclusion
<!-- How do we evaluate our progress and what will we do next?  -->

In conclusion, our journey with FOCO has not only helped us create a tool aimed at improving digital wellbeing, but also provided us with a strong foundation in entrepreneurship. Throughout the development of FOCO, we were able to connect with a number of potential investors who saw the value and impact of our app. After thoughtful discussions and negotiations, we decided to allocate a total of 20% equity in exchange for their combined investment, which will be secured once our prototype is ready for public release.

Even before securing this major investment, we made several key moves using our initial seed funds. These included acquiring a domain for FOCO’s website and purchasing a Google Play license, allowing us to publish the app on the Play Store and make it accessible to Android users worldwide. These early steps were crucial in laying the groundwork for FOCO's public presence and upcoming launch.

Overall, this project has given us valuable insight into what it takes to build and grow a startup - from idea validation and prototype development, to pitching investors and making strategic business decisions. While we’re proud of how far FOCO has come, this is just the beginning. We’re committed to continuing the development of FOCO and expanding its reach, helping more people take control of their digital lives and find balance in an increasingly connected world.
