## Plan Progression
<!-- How far we have gotten with the business plan?  -->

Clearly, since first laying out our production timeline, we have made good progress towards setting up a sustainable and thriving business framework, already tackling a number of goals laid out in the Priority Roadmap Section (3.1). However, since then, we have also come across new information/insights. A good business plan is a dynamic one, hence we would like to point out some of the most notable changes we are making to proposed product and business strategy.


### Issue 1 - 2.6.2 Primary Challenges and Risks

#### Blocking Apps Successfully
<!-- How do we ensure that the MVP can actually block other apps? -->

In our planning phase, we correctly identified the ability (or lack thereof) of our app successfully blocking/restricting other apps as the greatest "existential threat" to our product. Whilst it is clear that others have successfully implemented such features, we were unsure how difficult this would be and so we immediately turned our attention to prototyping and verifying this for ourselves after the planning phase concluded. From this initial prototyping phase, we have confirmed that it is quite difficult to restrict other apps in this way. As a result, we have focussed our attention on researching, particularly in the Flutter documentation as well as similar projects and threads related to app restriction.

#### Going Cross-Platform
<!-- How do we ensure functionality across all OSs? -->

Following on from this, we have identified a number of potential methods and are in the process of testing each one. However, these methods are now raising a second potential risk to the business plan as several of them are OS specific, and so using them would mean narrowing our target audience quite significantly. We believe this to be a pertinent issue as a lack of cross-compatibility would substantially limit our potential revenue and are considering different ways of circumventing this issue (mainly, whether we keep researching for an all-encompassing solution for each OS, or implementing specific solutions for each one).


### Issue 2 - 2.7 Assumptions and Risk Assessment

On a related topic, we will be adding the issue of cross-compatibility to our official risk assessment based on the reasoning specified above.


### Issue 3 - 2.2 Use Cases and Storyboarding

#### Setting permissions
<!-- How will the system interact with app permission settings? -->

While we have several potential methods with different approaches, one area in which they all share from is their use of permissions. From the beginning, it was obvious to us that the app would require the user to allow FOCO with some form of permissions, however it seems that we overlooked this when writing out our business plan. Hence, we will add this part of the user experience to our storyboards. Furthermore, we have begun noting down (from our prototyping) what specific permissions may be required.


#### Blocking method
<!-- How will the blocking method be manifested to the user? -->

Additionally, we also decided to rethink how the blocking/restriction would actually be manifested to the user. While superficial, we did not properly consider what the block would look like, whether simply creating a notification or fully displaying a window to the user. Such gaps in design are to be expected as each of us has our own ideas and we all implicity have a collective idea, yet we failed to properly transfer this to our design. We are continuing to mull over the best way to present this to the user (since this is the primary barrier, we believe that implementing this well or poorly will impact how effectively FOCO assists the user psychologically in conquering their bad screen habits). As part of this, we are revisiting our market research and rigorously documenting the methods used by our competitors, weighting up their pros and cons, and we will soon use this to inform the development of our initial product.
