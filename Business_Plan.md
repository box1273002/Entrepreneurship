## A Business Plan

#### 1.1 The Problem

In today's digital age, screen time dependency has become a widespread issue, with over **53% of Americans** seeking to reduce their phone usage to improve time management, mental health, and focus. However, breaking free from screen addiction is no easy feat — **49% of people** feel addicted to their devices, and **69% of Gen Z** openly acknowledge their phone dependency.

Our research also uncovered a critical gap in the market — existing screen time management apps, such as *Opal*, rely on rigid blocking mechanisms that can be inconvenient and demotivating for users.

#### 1.2 Case Studies

**Dhru's Story:** Dhru, one of FOCO's dedicated developers, once struggled with screen addiction himself. His overuse of social media led to missed job interviews and strained relationships, prompting him to reclaim his time and join FOCO’s mission. Dhru’s journey highlights the emotional toll of digital overuse and the urgent need for a balanced, mindful approach to screen time management.

**Another Case Study:** A regular user of screen time management software like *Opal* shared his frustration with the app’s inflexibility, particularly with apps like WhatsApp. When he blocked WhatsApp to stay focused, he found himself stuck waiting for up to 5 minutes before accessing the app when he genuinely needed to communicate. This rigid approach discouraged other users from adopting similar apps, reinforcing the need for a more flexible and user-centric solution.  Competitors do not enable users to block apps and also ensure they can use them when they truly need to. This is a significant limitation, competitors should be encouraging balance and purposeful in how their user use their time. This could enable users to have a healthy relationship with their digital reality. However this is not done with most competitors encouraging an all or nothing mentality - have it blocked indefinitely or not at all.
