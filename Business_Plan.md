# FOCO: Creating a credit-based screen time limiter app
## A Business Plan

### 1. Our Product

#### 1.1 The Problem

In today's digital age, screen time dependency has become a widespread issue, with over **53% of Americans** seeking to reduce their phone usage to improve time management, mental health, and focus. However, breaking free from screen addiction is no easy feat — **49% of people** feel addicted to their devices, and **69% of Gen Z** openly acknowledge their phone dependency.

Our research also uncovered a critical gap in the market — existing screen time management apps, such as *Opal*, rely on rigid blocking mechanisms that can be inconvenient and demotivating for users.

#### 1.2 Case Studies

**Dhru's Story:** Dhru, one of FOCO's dedicated developers, once struggled with screen addiction himself. His overuse of social media led to missed job interviews and strained relationships, prompting him to reclaim his time and join FOCO’s mission. Dhru’s journey highlights the emotional toll of digital overuse and the urgent need for a balanced, mindful approach to screen time management.

**Another Case Study:** A regular user of screen time management software like *Opal* shared his frustration with the app’s inflexibility, particularly with apps like WhatsApp. When he blocked WhatsApp to stay focused, he found himself stuck waiting for up to 5 minutes before accessing the app when he genuinely needed to communicate. This rigid approach discouraged other users from adopting similar apps, reinforcing the need for a more flexible and user-centric solution.  Competitors do not enable users to block apps and also ensure they can use them when they truly need to. This is a significant limitation, competitors should be encouraging balance and purposeful in how their user use their time. This could enable users to have a healthy relationship with their digital reality. However this is not done with most competitors encouraging an all or nothing mentality - have it blocked indefinitely or not at all.

#### 1.3 Our Solution

Imagine the same scenario — but with FOCO’s innovative coin system.

Instead of a strict lockout, the user allocates coins to WhatsApp, deciding how much time they’re willing to “spend” on the app. When the coins run out, access is blocked — not as a punishment but as a natural consequence of spending their digital currency. This transforms screen time management into a strategic, gamified experience rather than a restrictive one. We will introduce a solution.

#### 1.4 App and Product Description

*FOCO* is a playful, gamified screen time management app designed to help users take back control of their digital habits, one coin at a time! 

This is a simple and powerful app where every week, the users sets a fixed number of coins. These coins can then be spent to unlock and use specific apps for a limited time.

Once their coins run out, access to their pre-selected locked apps are completely blocked until the next reset. 

**But Why?**

This scarcity encourages users to be intentional and strategic with their screen time, treating their digital attention as a valuable currency that is always has been. We recognise that time is the user's commodity and we help the user be purposeful with how they spend it online.

Our system will consist of a free verion and a premium version:
- **Free Version:**
    - Set a fixed number of weekly coins
    - Spend coins to unlock selected apps for a period of time
    - Locked apps become inaccessible once coins run out
    - Watch ads to earn extra coins
    - Simple hourly rate settings for app access
- **Premium Version:**
    - No ads, no data collection
    - Advanced locking features (puzzles, weekday locks)
    - Customizable coin schedules (higher coin costs for evenings or binge sessions)
    - Daily coin “weaning” feature to reduce digital dependency
    - Adjustable weekly coin caps for progressive time management

**The Service We Are Developing** 

The app will run on Android.

We will utilise gamification, behavioral psychology, and simple finance-style mechanisms (coins, investments) to create a fun app that helps users break free from digital addiction or casual users who want to be purposeful with their time.

### 2. Market Section

#### 2.1 Market Research Goals

To ensure that our product provides users with the most effective productivity service on the market, we first performed extensive research. Our main lines of questioning were as follows:

- Target market and user needs: what demographics make up our target audience and why do these users consume these products?
- Market size and demand: how many people actively seek screen time control solutions and how will this change into the future?
- Competitive landscape: what existing apps offer screen time restrictions, and how do they work, how do competitors monetize their apps and what are the strengths and weaknesses of competing products?

#### 2.2 Secondary Research

**Target market and user needs:**

Our research has shown that the market for productivity and time management apps is expanding, driven by increased smartphone usage and work-from-home trends. Demand for time tracking in both personal and professional contexts indicates potential for subscription-based monetization models. [1]

From analyzing the literature on the subject, we confirmed that most of the target audience would use the system as an intervention rather than as a guide. Based on this, we tailored our app to take into account the relationships of the user with their family and friends. By involving families in the intervention (in a Family Media Plan [2]), the project aimed to create tailored strategies for managing screen time, which can be supported by caregivers modeling healthy behaviors. This approach is essential for fostering long-term changes in media habits among adolescents. Intervening technologies are most effective when paired with support and enforcement of a third-party.

The benefits of the intervention were not just short-term; participants in [3] maintained lower levels of smartphone use and improved well-being for at least six weeks after the intervention ended. Ensuring that the user makes it through the initial few days is the hardest part in the “rehabilitation” timeline, hence it is a part we need to focus on the most in terms of encouraging and motivating the user.

**Market size and demand:**

- Screen time management has become crucial due to rising smartphone and computer use, with adults averaging over 6 hours daily and children 3–4 hours. [4]
- What surprised us when assessing the market demand for this system was just how severe the problem of screen addiction was, especially with children. Increasing amount of time children spend on screens and the associated negative health outcomes, such as poor academic performance and obesity [5].
- From looking at other similar systems, one standout aspects of many successful systems such as App Limit Monitor [6]. Users can tailor their screen time limits according to their personal needs and preferences, making it a flexible solution for different lifestyles. We realized that a  successful app should be highly flexible to allow the user to customize their settings in whatever way they wish (if they feel they cannot achieve their desired settings they may disengage), whilst also being restrictive in the areas it needs to be, the screen time limiter [6, 7].

**Competitive landscape:**

When assessing the competitive landscape, we were able to identify a number of successful competing systems, proving that this idea is tried and true. Nevertheless, we identified several gaps in the market which we look to exploit (see Main Competitors). Some applications and their revenues are listed below:

- Clarymind (launched Dec 2023) reduces screen time by up to 2 hours/day through AI-driven mindfulness features like 10-second pause before app use, guided meditation, sleep aids (calming music).
- ScreenTime+ ($15K/month) and BePresent ($10K/month) show strong market demand for screen management tools.

Despite several competitors, our data shows that the market is yet to be fully saturated. The parental control software market ($1.25B in 2023) is projected to grow to $3.54B by 2032 at 12.3% CAGR. Factors driving growth include: increased mobile use, pandemic-induced digital habits, and rising demand for parental controls.

In terms of business models, most competitors opt for a subscription model to maintain a constant income. Clarymind [4] for example operates on a subscription model (Monthly: $14.99 | 6-Month: $49.99 | Yearly: $62.99 | Pro: $34.99), estimated to generate ~$2M annually with 100,000+ active users.
