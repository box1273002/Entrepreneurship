# FOCO: Creating a credit-based screen time limiter app
## A Business Plan

### 1. Our Product

#### 1.1 The Problem

In today's digital age, screen time dependency has become a widespread issue, with over **53% of Americans** seeking to reduce their phone usage to improve time management, mental health, and focus. However, breaking free from screen addiction is no easy feat — **49% of people** feel addicted to their devices, and **69% of Gen Z** openly acknowledge their phone dependency.

Our research also uncovered a critical gap in the market — existing screen time management apps, such as *Opal*, rely on rigid blocking mechanisms that can be inconvenient and demotivating for users.

#### 1.2 Case Studies

**Dhru's Story:** Dhru, one of FOCO's dedicated developers, once struggled with screen addiction himself. His overuse of social media led to missed job interviews and strained relationships, prompting him to reclaim his time and join FOCO’s mission. Dhru’s journey highlights the emotional toll of digital overuse and the urgent need for a balanced, mindful approach to screen time management.

**Another Case Study:** A regular user of screen time management software like *Opal* shared his frustration with the app’s inflexibility, particularly with apps like WhatsApp. When he blocked WhatsApp to stay focused, he found himself stuck waiting for up to 5 minutes before accessing the app when he genuinely needed to communicate. This rigid approach discouraged other users from adopting similar apps, reinforcing the need for a more flexible and user-centric solution.  Competitors do not enable users to block apps and also ensure they can use them when they truly need to. This is a significant limitation, competitors should be encouraging balance and purposeful in how their user use their time. This could enable users to have a healthy relationship with their digital reality. However this is not done with most competitors encouraging an all or nothing mentality - have it blocked indefinitely or not at all.

#### 1.3 Our Solution

Imagine the same scenario — but with FOCO’s innovative coin system.

Instead of a strict lockout, the user allocates coins to WhatsApp, deciding how much time they’re willing to “spend” on the app. When the coins run out, access is blocked — not as a punishment but as a natural consequence of spending their digital currency. This transforms screen time management into a strategic, gamified experience rather than a restrictive one. We will introduce a solution.

#### 1.4 App and Product Description

*FOCO* is a playful, gamified screen time management app designed to help users take back control of their digital habits, one coin at a time! 

This is a simple and powerful app where every week, the users sets a fixed number of coins. These coins can then be spent to unlock and use specific apps for a limited time.

Once their coins run out, access to their pre-selected locked apps are completely blocked until the next reset. 

**But Why?**
This scarcity encourages users to be intentional and strategic with their screen time, treating their digital attention as a valuable currency that is always has been. We recognise that time is the user's commodity and we help the user be purposeful with how they spend it online.

Our system will consist of a free verion and a premium version:
- **Free Version:**
    - Set a fixed number of weekly coins
    - Spend coins to unlock selected apps for a period of time
    - Locked apps become inaccessible once coins run out
    - Watch ads to earn extra coins
    - Simple hourly rate settings for app access
- **Premium Version:**
    - No ads, no data collection
    - Advanced locking features (puzzles, weekday locks)
    - Customizable coin schedules (higher coin costs for evenings or binge sessions)
    - Daily coin “weaning” feature to reduce digital dependency
    - Adjustable weekly coin caps for progressive time management

**The Service We Are Developing** 

The app will run on Android.
